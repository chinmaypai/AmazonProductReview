The waist stands off of my body and the pants slip down annoyingly and require a belt (cinched pretty tight) to keep from losing them completely. Bear in mind, I don't have a tiny waist. I was hoping for thicker fabric for warmth to wear with boots and a sweater. I would classify these as \"summer weight\" corduroy. Which seems like it shouldn't be a thing, but apparently is. I wear a size 8-10.",

They are a true \"skinny pant\" meaning if you have thicker calves or thighs, they may not work. I am 5'10 and normally a size 8...these are a size 10 and fit perfectly, so definitely size up one size for a correct fit. The length is truly an ankle length on average height people, but with me being a bit taller they hit slightly above the ankle which still looks cute. They have a nice stretch to them and don't sag at the end of the day as some stretchy pants do. I love the fabric. It is a medium weight corduroy that keeps me warm. I wash all of my clothes in a delicate cycle and hang to dry and these pants have done well that way. I would hesitate to dry them in the dryer, as they may shrink. These pants look great for my casual office environment and I can also wear them to run errands or volunteer at my child's school without them being \"too casual\" or \"too dressy.\" They are the perfect in-between, versatile piece that pairs well with a casual sweater or a nice blouse and you can dress them up or down with sneakers or a fun heel.",

These pants fit snugly, but not at all uncomfortably, and considering their tight looking fit, they feel pretty good all around, with just a very light stretch to them. I can even sit cross legged in them on the ground w no problem. The waistband feels roomy and non-binding. The corduroy has very thin ridges, and you can't even tell it's corduroy from a few feet away- it just looks kinda velvety. I read that corduroy is coming back in style- and particularly in men's clothing. I like it because i'm a tactile person, love texture, and these are very nice pants.",

This material is stiffer, itchier and doesn't keep its shape as well. What this means is that although when I pull them on the pant is super skin tight, after a few hours of moving around, the material stretches out and sags. I usually wear a 6 and these are an 8. They fit perfectly snugly around the waist at first, so I would have advised to size up ... however, after 3 hours, the waist was not only no longer snug, it was positively gaping. Which, okay, I can wear a belt so it's not that big of a deal, but my AG cords don't do this. I should also warn that the legs are incredibly tight, so tight in fact I had trouble getting in and out of them and my legs aren't especially thick. I do love that the front pockets are actual usable pockets rather than fake pockets. And the dark grey color is really great.",

Iron warm. - About half an inch stretch in waist, a bit more in the seat, tapers down the leg - Stitching looks good The legs are really skinny. Maybe the skinniest I've seen, even with some stretch.

While I love Daily Ritual, I've had a hard time getting the sizing right for the pants, because they vary so greatly on the sizing, even from different colors of the exact same pants. After losing a great deal of weight and gaining a bit of it back, I wasn't initially sure what size I'd wear. 12 seems to be my average right now, though, until I get the extra off again. Some 12s I've tried from Daily Ritual have been way too loose, while some of them have been too tight for me to tolerate. (While I prefer a skinny design, I don't care for tight pants. I also don't want them sagging, so that I have to pull them up constantly.) All that I've tried so far do stretch through the day, though, except for the ankle part. For this pair, the top does start out on the snug side for my tastes, but it's fine. Based on several pair I've tried, these corduroy ones do fit on the snugger side for 12s. (A white pair I tried was the snuggest and a light stone wash pair I tried were the loosest. I think a 10 would have been perfect in those.) If you don't mind the lower legs being super skinny, I can easily recommend giving them a try, but be prepared for a bit of effort getting the right size.",

I'm currently wearing them after a rather indulgent vacation that makes me a big nervous to step on the scale, and they're still very comfortable, despite my vacation muffin tops. While very comfy, the thinner fabric puts them more in jeggings than pants territory if you're plump. (They do still have proper pockets, at least.) The waist is a good fit for big-hipped women--often jeans and cords gap at my waist, giving me plumber's butt. These fit as they should, classic jeans-style rise, neither high nor low.",

They do have a bit of stretch to them but if you have to ware a wide calf boot or have trouble with your thighs fitting skinny jeans I would pass on these. They are soft inside and comfortable. It has small girl pockets in front and large back pockets. I don't think I will keep these. I have a nice round but, and front and this makes me look like two toothpicks holding up a round ball.

Waist is just a tad in the high side but not enough that I\u2019d call them high waisted. Length is average which for me at 5\u20193\u201d is a bit long (but manageable with skinnies). However these run small. The hips and but are small, definitely size up if you\u2019re between. The legs are even smaller, especially lower legs. They don\u2019t have a ton of stretch which is nice for avoiding the dreaded pajam jeans look but means you really need to size up for comfort. This was surprising because the Daily Ritual tops and dresses have run on the larger side I typically wear a 29 comfortably but a 10 is a little too snug.",
